# clution.lib

Library backend for [clution](https://github.com/Zulu-Inuoe/clution).

Utilities for read/writing ASDF files, .clu files, building projects, and so on.

*Warning*: I don't recommend using this directly any time soon.
The API is highly volatile and tied to [clution](https://github.com/Zulu-Inuoe/clution).
