CL-UTILITIES Collection
=======================

On Cliki.net <http://www.cliki.net/Common%20Lisp%20Utilities>, there
is a collection of Common Lisp Utilities, things that everybody writes
since they're not part of the official standard. There are some very
useful things there; the only problems are that they aren't
implemented as well as you'd like (some aren't implemented at all) and
they aren't conveniently packaged and maintained. It takes quite a bit
of work to carefully implement utilities for common use, commented
and documented, with error checking placed everywhere some dumb user
might make a mistake.

The CLRFI process <http://clrfi.alu.org/> is a lot better thought out,
and will probably produce better standards than informal discussion on
a Wiki, but it has one problem: at the time of this writing, it's not
doing anything yet. Until the CLRFI process gets going, I think that a
high-quality collection of the informal standards on Cliki is a
valuable thing to have. It's here, and it's called cl-utilities.

The home page is <http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-utilities/>.

Documentation
-------------

Right now, documentation is at
<http://www.cliki.net/Common%20Lisp%20Utilities>. There are a few
differences, though:

* The READ-DELIMITED function takes :start and :end keyword args.
* A WITH-GENSYMS function is provided for compatibility.
* COPY-ARRAY is not called SHALLOW-COPY-ARRAY.
* The ONCE-ONLY macro is included.

Installation
------------

To install cl-utilities, you'll need to do one of two things:

* Download cl-utilities into a place where asdf can find it, then
  load it via asdf. You will also need to get the split-sequence
  package, which cl-utilities depends on.

-or-

* Use asdf-install: (asdf-install:install :cl-utilities)

Feedback
--------

The current maintainer is Peter Scott. If you have questions, bugs,
comments, or contributions, please send them to the cl-utilities-devel
mailing list, <cl-utilities-devel@common-lisp.net>.
